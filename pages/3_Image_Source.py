In digital imaging, an image is typically represented as a two-dimensional array of pixels, each of which represents a unique color or shade of gray. The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels in the array, with higher resolutions resulting in sharper and more detailed images.")

To reduce the file size of an image for storage and transmission, various compression techniques can be applied, such as lossy and lossless compression. Lossy compression techniques use algorithms to eliminate or reduce redundant information in an image, resulting in a smaller file size but with some loss of image quality. Lossless compression techniques, on the other hand, retain all of the original image data and achieve smaller file sizes through more efficient encoding.")
